# pwc_assesment

* I have done this project using eclipse, it is done as a normal "Dynamic Web Project" (not a maven project).

* Screenshots of the project pages can be found under path:
/pwc_assesment/WebContent/Documentation/screenshots

* This project includes H2 embeded DB, so no need to configure it, just run the project and the code creates the required tables for you.
